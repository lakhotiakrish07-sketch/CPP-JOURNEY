##Student Grade Evaluation System (C++)
About

This is a simple C++ program that checks a student's grade based on the marks entered by the user.

The program uses if-else ladder to decide the grade.

##How It Works

User enters marks (0–100)

Program checks the marks

It prints the grade according to the marks

If marks are invalid, it shows an error message

##Grade System

90–100 → O
80–89 → A+
70–79 → A
60–69 → B
50–59 → C
Below 50 → Fail

##What I Learned

If-else ladder

Logical operators (&&, ||)

Taking input using cin

Basic program flow

##How to Run

Save the file as grade.cpp

Compile using:
g++ grade.cpp -o grade

Run:
./grade
