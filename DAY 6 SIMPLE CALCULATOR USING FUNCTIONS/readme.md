# Day 6 - Functions in C++

This project demonstrates the use of functions in C++.

## Concepts Covered

- Function Prototype
- Function Definition
- Function Calling
- Return Types
- Parameter Passing
- Float Operations
- Basic Error Handling (Divide by Zero)

## Functions Implemented

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with zero check)
- Square of a number

## Learning Outcome

Today I understood how functions help in:
- Writing clean and reusable code
- Avoiding repetition
- Organizing logic properly

This project is part of my C++ learning journey.
